## Twitch Sanity Chat **Work in Progress**

The purpose of Sanity chat is to help reduce the amount of noise produced in the busier chats of Twitch. Due to the popularity of some channels, including the use of custom emoticons, with poor formatting making the readability worse than it could and should be.

I've found that due to the large height of each chat lines, the effect of a fast chat is made even worse. But when condensed each line moves less per new message, the work required to read a message is less and more information is displayed.

Other things, like how chat lacks tabulation meaning the eye has to scroll between different length  of usernames and stream badges, picking out little bits of information

It's common for people to care less about the chat as it becomes more and more flooded with information that isn't pertinent to their experience

While many people enjoy the use of emoticons, I tend to find them surplus to requirement or even obtrusive. Especially when a ChatSpam event happens.

I prefer to be in quieter chats that allow for more interaction with the streamer and other people in the chat
